# Initial Checklist

Make sure these basics are covered before sending cold emails:

-   ✅ **Email setup**: Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
-   ✅ **Warmup**: Warm up accounts for at least 2 weeks.
-   ✅ **Verified leads**: Clean and verify lead lists to avoid bounces.
-   ✅ **Tracking domain**: Use and warm up a custom tracking domain.
-   ✅ **Blacklist check**: Avoid domains listed on multiple blacklists.
-   ✅ **Domain website**: Point sending domains to a real website.

# Sending & Warmup Volumes

-   **Daily limit**: ~50 emails per account (including warmups).
-   **Split**: Start with 25 cold + 25 warmup per day.
-   **Adjust ratio**: Increase or decrease cold emails based on deliverability results.

### If performance drops:

-   Lower cold emails, increase warmups (e.g., 15 cold / 35 warmups).
-   Pause cold emails if needed, then scale back gradually.

### If performance is strong:

-   Increase cold emails (e.g., 30 cold / 20 warmups).
-   Test higher ratios slowly while monitoring results.

### Key Point

Keep daily volume around 50 emails per account, but **adjust cold-to-warmup ratio** based on deliverability and results.
