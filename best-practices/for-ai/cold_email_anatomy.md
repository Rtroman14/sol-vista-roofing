# Anatomy of a Good Cold Email

A cold email should have 3 key parts:

1. **Personalization**
2. **Offer**
3. **Call to Action (CTA)**

---

## Personalization

-   Use specific compliments (achievements, blog posts, product releases, experience, case studies).
-   Manually written first lines work best for replies.
-   Personalized openers can **2x reply rates**.

---

## Offer

-   Strong offers matter more than copy.
-   Solve a real problem for your audience.
-   Best niches: SaaS, high-ticket consulting, funded startups, TikTok/influencer marketing, sustainability.
-   Avoid: outdated offers (SEO/web dev), very small markets, old-school businesses.
-   Get specific (e.g., “Facebook Ads for SaaS” vs. just “Facebook Ads”).

---

## Call to Action (CTA)

-   Use **low-friction CTAs** (don’t push meetings immediately).
-   Examples:
    -   “Mind if I send more info?”
    -   “Interested to hear more?”
    -   “When would be a good time for a 15-min call?”
    -   “Do I have your permission to share details?”
-   High-friction CTAs (Calendly links, long scheduling) reduce responses.

---

## Subject Lines

-   Keep short, personal, and natural.
-   Examples:
    -   “{{firstName}} – quick question”
    -   “Question about {{companyName}}”
    -   “Thoughts?”
    -   “Can you help, {{firstName}}?”

---

## Research

-   Know industry pain points and KPIs.
-   Ecom: Conversion Rate, AOV.
-   SaaS: MRR, Churn.
-   Use insights in your message to show understanding.

---

## Extra Strategies

-   **Permission-based**: Ask before sending details.
-   **Free Audit**: Offer a free audit in the first email.
-   **Urgency**: Create scarcity (“Only 2 spots left for July”).
-   **Plain text only**: No images, links, or fancy formatting.
-   **Spintax**: Use variations to avoid spam filters.

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

Limit to **4 emails max**:

1. Initial email
2. Quick bump (2 days later)
3. Value (case study, audit, video)
4. Break-up/funny email
