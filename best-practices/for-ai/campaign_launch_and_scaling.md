# Launching & Scaling Cold Email Campaigns

### Sending Limits

-   Max **50 emails/day per account** (including warmup).
-   Start low and scale slowly.

### Scaling Guidelines

-   Day 1: 5 emails/day
-   Day 5: 10 emails/day
-   Day 10: 15 emails/day
-   Day 15: 20 emails/day
-   Day 20: 25 cold + 25 warmup = 50 total/day

### Scaling Rules

1. Never exceed 50/day/account.
2. Start small, increase gradually.
3. Only scale if open rate >40% and warmup health >98%.
4. If performance drops → stop cold emails, run only warmup for 1–2 weeks.
5. Scale by **adding new domains/accounts**, not by pushing limits.
