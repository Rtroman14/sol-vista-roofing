# Other Deliverability Problems

Common issues that hurt email deliverability:

-   ❌ **Improper setup**: Missing SPF, DKIM, or DMARC.
-   ❌ **Bad subject lines**: Generic, salesy, or untargeted.
-   ❌ **No warmup**: Accounts not warmed up for at least 2 weeks.
-   ❌ **Over-sending**: More than 50 emails/day per account.
-   ❌ **Spam words**: Using common spam trigger words.
-   ❌ **No personalization**: Generic, non-targeted emails.
-   ❌ **Unverified leads**: High bounce risk, hurts reputation.
-   ❌ **Images**: Emails with images may land in spam.
-   ❌ **Links**: Too many links lower deliverability.
-   ❌ **No custom tracking domain**: Shared domains reduce inboxing.
-   ❌ **Blacklists**: Domains or links on blacklists hurt deliverability.
-   ❌ **Generic recipients**: Sending to `info@` or `support@` emails.
-   ❌ **Bad timing**: Sending after hours, weekends, or holidays.
-   ❌ **Provider IP reputation**: Ensure sending server’s IP is not blacklisted.
-   ❌ **Pixel blocking**: Some clients (e.g. Apple Mail) block tracking pixels.
-   ❌ **Domain not pointing to website**: Always link domain to a real site.
