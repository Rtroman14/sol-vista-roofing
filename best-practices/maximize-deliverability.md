-   Set up **SPF, DKIM, DMARC** in DNS settings
-   Clean & Verify Lead Lists (minimizes bounces)

## Inbox & Tracking

-   Inbox rotation
-   If you have a signature, keep it simple (no images or too many links)
-   If you want to track open rates, set up your own custom tracking domain
-   Warm custom tracking domain
-   Turn off badly performing inboxes
-   3–5 users/inboxes max per domain

## Email Content

-   **Plain Text Mode**
    -   No open or click tracking pixel
-   Avoid media in first email
    -   Video
    -   Images
    -   GIFs
